# Face-Swap-Open-CV-
Swapping of two Faces using Open-cv


**Description:** 
The Face Swapping is a mini-project that allows you to replace a face in an image with another face. It utilizes computer vision techniques and facial landmarks detection to accurately swap faces between two images.

**Features: **
 Face detection: The program detects faces in the input images using a pre-trained face detection model. 
 Facial landmarks detection: It identifies key facial landmarks on the detected faces, such as eyes, nose, and mouth. 
 Face swapping: The program swaps the face from one image onto the face of another image, ensuring alignment and natural blending. 
 Triangulation: It performs Delaunay triangulation to create a mesh of triangles on the faces for accurate face mapping. 
 Seamless blending: The swapped face is seamlessly blended with the target image to create a realistic and natural appearance. 
 User-friendly interface: The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and visualizing the results.

**Important:**
To use this program we have to import opencv, numpy and dlib. 
To install dlib refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-10/ . 
Also Download and Copy shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat File in the same directory containing the Code.
